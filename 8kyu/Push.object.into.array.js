// You are trying to put a hash in ruby or an object in javascript or java into an array, but it always returns error, solve it and keep it as simple as possible!

//items = []
//items.push {a: "b", c: "d"}
//my solution:
items = []
items.push ({a: "b", c: "d"})
//the initial code was missing a parantheses behind the push.
